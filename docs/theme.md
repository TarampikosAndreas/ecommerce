1. Add directory **templates** right under the 
project's folder and a **store** subfolder inside it

This file will be the template to be extended by all 
   other pages.
1. Included the necessary Bootstrap css and js (from cdn)
1. Added an index page just to see that the base template works
1. Loaded the index page from the respective index view.
